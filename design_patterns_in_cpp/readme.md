Creational Patterns: Manage object creation processes.

Structural Patterns: Define relationships between objects.

Behavioral Patterns: Handle interactions between objects and their responsibilities.

## The Most Relevant Design Patterns Today

Singleton: Used when only one instance of a class is needed globally, such as in logging systems or managing resources.

Factory Method: A vital pattern for dynamic object creation, used in various frameworks.

Adapter: Necessary for integrating legacy systems or third-party libraries.

Observer: Commonly found in event-driven systems, particularly for user interfaces and real-time updates.

Strategy: Used to dynamically choose algorithms at runtime, ensuring flexibility and performance.
