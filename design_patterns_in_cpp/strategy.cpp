class Strategy {
public:
  virtual void execute() = 0;
};

// Purpose: Allows for the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating
// each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime.

// Why Itâ€™s Used Today: The Strategy pattern is often employed in
// performance-critical systems where different algorithms need to be selected
// dynamically at runtime, such as sorting or data processing.

// Common Use Cases: Data processing, sorting algorithms, encryption techniques.
