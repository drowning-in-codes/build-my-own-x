# SimpleCV
SimpleCV is a simple and elegant CV template written in [Typst](https://typst.app/) 
aimed at (but not limited to!) people with an engineering background. The template was
inspired by two Latex CV templates ([[1]](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/autocv/scfvqfpxncwb),
[[2]](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc)).
Feel free to create an issue if you have any questions or notice errors.

# Usage
Create a new Typst project and copy the whole content of the `src` directory
into the project. Change the contents of the `src/main.typ` file according to your own needs. This should be it. 
You can find an example of what the CV looks like in `example.pdf`. 

# License
The template itself is available under the MIT license. The icons are
